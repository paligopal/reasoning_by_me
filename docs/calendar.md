<h1 style="text-align: center;">CALENDAR</h1>

## 1. About 
In this chapter, we will explore the relationship between days and dates in the context of our real-world calendar. We will also delve into the structure of weeks, months, years, and centuries, examining how they are interconnected with days and dates.

## 2. General Year vs Leap Year
We all know there are two types of years in our calendar: the general year and the leap year. In this section, we will explore these two types in depth and uncover the reasons behind their existence.

**Do you know that there is a relation between the revolution of earth around the sun and these years ?**

#### 2.1 Understanding the earth's revolution and calendar year
- We often hear that the Earth takes one year to revolve around the sun, and that's why the calendar changes. But thatâ€™s not entirely true!
- In reality, the Earth takes approximately 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, and 12 seconds to complete one revolution around the sun. While some may not accept this, letâ€™s assume it's accurate for this discussion. :)
- To simplify calculations, can we round 5 hours, 48 minutes, and 12 seconds to 6 hours?
- In a regular year, we move to the next year after 365 days, even though the Earth hasn't completed its full revolution. This means we're advancing to the next year 6 hours earlier than the actual revolution completion.
- As a result, there's a 6-hour gap between the calendar year and the Earthâ€™s revolution each year.
- Over 4 years, these 6-hour differences add up to 24 hours, or one full day. Simple math, right?
- Therefore, after 4 years, thereâ€™s a one-day discrepancy between the Earthâ€™s revolution and the calendar.
- To align the calendar with the Earth's revolution, we introduce a leap year, adding an extra day to the year, making it 366 days long.
- In essence, we add one extra day every 4 years, making the leap year a regular part of our calendar system.

#### 2.2 Identifying a year type (General or Leap Year)
In this section, we will learn how to identify whether a given year is a general year or a leap year. From the previous section, we know that a leap year occurs every 4 years, so divisibility by 4 plays a key role in this identification.

**Example:**
Given the year 1996, the task is to determine if it's a general or leap year. Simply check if 1996 is divisible by 4. Since it is, 1996 is a leap year.

**Do you know century year doesn't follow the above stated rule of identifying the year type ?**
##### 2.2.1 Identifying a century year type
- For century years, the standard leap year rule (every 4 years) does not apply.
- Instead, century years follow a special rule: only every 4th century is a leap year, meaning the year must be divisible by 400.
    **Example-**
    Consider the year 2100, a century year. To determine whether 2100 is a leap year or a general year, we check if it is divisible by 400. Since it's not, 2100 is not a leap year. Interesting, right ? :)
##### 2.2.2 Understanding math behind 400 rule
- Remember in section 2.1, we rounded 5 hours, 48 minutes, and 12 seconds to 6 hours?
- By rounding, we ignored a gap of 11 minutes and 48 seconds, which equals 0.0075 days. Donâ€™t believe it? Try converting it yourself! ðŸ˜‰
- This small gap means the calendar is behind the Earth's revolution by 0.0075 days each year. It seems negligible, right? But it adds up!
- Over 400 years, this gap totals 3 daysâ€”quite surprising, isnâ€™t it?
- To account for this 3-day difference, we skip 3 leap years across 4 centuries.
- This is why only every 4th century is a leap year.
